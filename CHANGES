0.1.1 (19-12-2007)
=====
* Changed API:
 - Simply create a song record with get_song
 - Test wether your song record is valid for each submission
   type
 - submit and do_submit now return a list of songs that
   couldn't be submited, along with the explanation
 - get, do_np and do_submit now give another try when failed
   authentification can be due to caching inconsistency
 - anonymous get requests are somehow better handled when caching.
   However, you should not use get for multiple simultaneous anonymous
   streaming.
 + Better Radio protocol reversing, removed no longer available 
   playlist url.
 + Close http connection when error is raised by underlying modul
